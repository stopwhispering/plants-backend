# plants-backend
Flask-based RESTful Database Application for Tracking Plants

## Frontend
Open UI5-based web frontend, see [plants-frontend](https://github.com/stopwhispering/plants-frontend).

## Webserver / Reverse Proxy
The sample architecture uses NGINX and uWSGI as middleware. uWSGI can use the flask app returned by
the factory method in *app.py*. On local system one can use the Flask development server
instead (*python wsgi.py*).

![Architecture](static/architecture.png?raw=true "Architecture")

## Configuration
see *config.py* and *config_local.py*, the latter used to set environment-specific
settings like db connection string, logging minimum severity, or to allow CORS
on development environment

## Database
Iâ€™m using SQLite. Thanks to SQLAlchemy (ORM), switching to any other major
relational database should work by simply changing connection string via environment
variable..
Some specific logic is implemented, though, to manage the point in time when auto-incremented
IDs are determined.
